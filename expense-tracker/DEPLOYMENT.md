   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Deploy on Render:**
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Sign up with GitHub
   - Click "New +" → "Web Service"
   - Select your repository
   - Use these settings:
     - **Build Command**: `./build.sh`
     - **Start Command**: `cd backend && python app.py`
   - Click "Create Web Service"

4. **Your app will be live in 2-3 minutes!** 🎉

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Set these on your deployment platform:

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `PYTHON_VERSION` | `3.11.5` | Python version |
| `PORT` | Platform default | Server port |
| `FLASK_DEBUG` | `False` | Production mode |

## 🎯 Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] ML model predictions work
- [ ] Can add expenses
- [ ] Charts display correctly
- [ ] Database persists data
- [ ] Mobile responsive

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Fails:**
   - Check Python version in `runtime.txt`
   - Ensure `requirements.txt` has correct versions

2. **ML Model Not Loading:**
   - Make sure `build.sh` runs during deployment
   - Check if `expense_categorizer.pkl` exists

3. **Database Issues:**
   - SQLite works on most platforms
   - Database file will be created automatically

4. **Static Files Not Loading:**
   - Verify file paths in Flask app
   - Check static folder structure

## 📊 Performance Tips

- **Database**: Consider upgrading to PostgreSQL for production
- **ML Model**: Cache predictions for better performance
- **Static Files**: Use CDN for better loading speeds
- **Monitoring**: Add error tracking (Sentry, etc.)

## 🎉 You're Live!

Once deployed, your expense tracker will be available at a public URL. Share it with friends, add it to your portfolio, and show it to recruiters!

## 📱 Mobile App (Future)

Consider wrapping your web app as a mobile app using:
- **PWA** (Progressive Web App)
- **Cordova/PhoneGap**
- **React Native** (if you rebuild the frontend)
